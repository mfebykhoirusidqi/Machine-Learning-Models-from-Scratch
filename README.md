# Machine-Learning-Models-from-Scratch
🧠 Machine Learning Models from Scratch --- This repository demonstrates the mathematical intuition and implementation of essential machine learning algorithms built entirely from scratch using Python and NumPy. The goal is to bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical model development — showing how core ML algorithms truly work behind the scenes.

✨ By studying and experimenting with this repository, you will gain a solid intuition about how modern AI models build upon these foundational algorithms — transforming raw mathematics into intelligent systems.
